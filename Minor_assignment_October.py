"""
1. Make a python program as classes & objects.
    - Make the class methods name it as "generateNum()" that generates any single number between (0 to 7).
    - Make another class method name it as "getUserInput()" to ask user to enter their own number.
    - Make another class method name it as "Evaluate()" to match both the numbers, 
        -> if match found then print 'number is found' 
        -> else print 'number not found'

    test your class working by creating 2 different class instances(or can say objects)

    
2. Make the python programming as classes and objects.
    - Make the class constructor that takes stores student_name, math_marks
    - Make the class method name it as "stud_info()" that takes and builds the list that stores these variable values and returns that list.

    - Now make the different instances of the class and pass studen_name and math_marks as argument to the constructor
    - Make the different class instances as stud_01, stud_02 and stud_03 and then call stud_info().
    - On stud_info() method by different instances of the class w'll get the list of each instances, now store that list into a dictionary as values and class instances name as key of that dictionary.

    'Example:'
    stud_01 = ['max', 78]
    stud_02 = ['rohan', 99]
    stud_03 = ['raman', 100]

    Final Dictinary must look like:
    stud_dict = {
        'stud_01': ['max', 78],
        'stud_02': ['rohan', 99],
        'stud_03': ['raman', 100]
    }
